# Snyk-Cloud-GCP

This is a vulnerable by design repository for demonstrating Snyk Cloud. Do not deploy this in production.

## Deployment

To use with ACG - <b> you must first login to the GCP console and accept the terms and enable the Cloud Resource Manager & 
Service Usage  API</b>

Once logged in, go here: 
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring.googleapis.com/ to enable the Cloud Resource Manager API. 

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/serviceusage.googleapis.com/ to enable Service Usage


To locate the project ID, look in the GCP credentials string.

Add the following Github Variables:

```
SNYK_ORG
SNYK_TOKEN
GCP_CREDENTIALS
GCP_PROJECT_ID
```

To deploy, just commit and push a change in the <b>_build_flag</b> file. This will kick off the Github Action.

## Cleanup

To delete the environment from Snyk Cloud use the UI or the following command:

```
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/YOUR-ORGANIZATION-ID/cloud/environments/YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-ID?version=2022-12-21~beta' \
  -H 'Authorization: token YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-TOKEN'
```
